# Preparing for Hack The Box's CPTS    
## Overview

The Certified Penetration Testing Specialist or CPTS has less than 300 or so qualified individuals (as of Jan 2024), and not many third party resources floating about. Personally I like to research the heck out of something before I decide to go for it, so I decided to write about my real life experience, and include some helpful tips and tricks.  

## The Exam

- Fully hands-on, zero multiple choice questions.
- Requires 100% completion of the HTB academy [penetration testing job role path.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/penetration-tester)
- Black box environment.
- Zero limitations on tools.
- 10 days total to complete all exam requirements. Including:
    - A professional penetration test report.
    - A minimum number of flags (or a score of 85/100).
- You receive 2 exam attempts per voucher.
- You can reference the academy modules at anytime during the exam.
- Since the exam is a black box test you’ll know very little about the exam environment before hitting the ‘start exam’ button. Once you do everything will be explained to you. This may feel uncomfortable to some but that’s totally normal! Trust yourself that you already have the skills and knowledge to succeed.

## Preparing

Beginners should NOT rush through the academy path just to take the exam. The academy modules will teach you everything you need for the exam, but the CPTS is no joke. It will slap you in the face if you think you can just use automated tools and copy/paste. You should feel very comfortable performing any and all of the exercises found inside the penetration testing path. If your struggling with a particular module, make sure to take some extra notes and generate some cheat sheets. I know with my luck the one thing I don't study ALWAYS ends up being on the exam. Practicing the 'Attacking Enterprise Networks' module with a 2 day time limit and not using the module resources, is a pretty solid gauge of how ready you are for the test.

For reference it takes folks anywhere from 40 - 90+ days to complete the entire penetration testing job role path. Mostly it depends on how much time you can devote to the academy each day, I took around 3 months to complete it, averaging about 1 to 3 hours every Mon-Fri. I was in no rush to complete the path because I learned a ton from (most) of the modules, and I felt they provided a lot of value. One of the biggest tips I'm going to stress over and over is `take amazing notes.` R**ecord all the commands you use inside the modules! Especially…especially the ones you aren’t familiar with.** I'll dive more into how to take better notes in another section.

## My experience

Well... I failed... My first attempt. I passed on my second attempt which means the exam took me 20 days and I ended up with a roughly 70 page report. I’d say the exam wasn’t any harder than a typical easy/medium box on the regular HTB platform. That being said it was no joke! Honestly I wasted a lot of time exploring rabbit holes and looking at the same things over and over. To avoid this I suggest looking into something for 20-30 minutes, set a timer if you need to, and then move on if nothing new comes from it. On the other hand if you find yourself circling back to the same exact thing over and over, well you should probably investigate that thing.

I took the exam over a holiday break so I didn't have to worry about balancing work and the exam. I also know myself and I knew I was going to go 150% to try and pass the damn thing. Well true to form, I went hard. Real hard. Burn-out is a real thing and do NOT recommend.

I'd tell you not to do it this way but you'll probably ignore me. So... know yourself. If you are you one of those people (like myself) who turns on their military ‘get-it-done’ brain, make sure you take care of yourself. Meal prep, schedule outside time, exercise, follow a routine.

One thing I wish I practiced more prior to the exam was actually my methodology. What am I going to look at first? What are my priorities? How about after that? Okay what if I can't find anything? Having a general strategy and plan of attack helps you stay organized. I can't say much else since I don't want to spoil anything but *take good notes*, I can't emphasize this enough. 

> The better your notes are, the easier and faster your report will go, and the faster you can redo steps you already did.
{: .prompt-tip }

Your notes are critical incase you need to reset the environment or use your second exam attempt. 

Recently a friend asked me if it was possible for a ‘casual hacker’ to pass the exam. Maybe you're not yet in the Infosec field, or maybe you just have a busy schedule. 

> I just don't have 5-8 hours a day to spare... can I still pass?
{: .prompt-warning }

The exam is large, no doubt about it. Having less time means you need to be really smart with the time you do have. That being said, it's totally doable. Once you have an exam voucher you can start your exam anytime you'd like. There's no testing center to schedule or proctor watching your every move. That is some **seriously** great flexibility. If you fail the first attempt you still have another 10 days. So honestly you can think of the exam as a 20-day exam if it helps. Control any outside factors as best as you can, and make sure your notes, cheat sheets, and methodology are really dialed in. 

For note taking I used Obsidian but come exam time you should have your own favorite note taking app established (CherryTree, Joplin, ~~onenote~~). I also used a full day to knock out the majority of my report, so finishing it the second week was a breeze. Once again if you `take good notes` throughout the exam, you'll cut your reporting time down significantly.

The length of the report does not really matter so don't worry about it. You just need to include all the [major aspects of a penetration test report](https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/penetration-testing-reports-template-and-guide#how_to_write_impressive_penetration_testing_reports_) (this is covered in the reporting module). You'll need:

- Executive summary
- Recommendations or remediation's
- Technical findings
- Appendices

HTB also offers Sysreptor, a pretty cool reporting tool for this, as well as a regular Word document template. What reporting tool you use is totally up to you. Regardless of how you do on the exam, be sure to hand-in a report regardless of how *absolutely garbage* it is. This enables you to get your extra exam attempt, and also allows you to get feedback from the grading team (and maybe, just maybe... a nudge). One reason to hand-in a quality pentest report instead of that hot garbage you made is so you don't miss out on valuable feedback directly from the graders. After my first attempt I got some solid feedback with how to improve. My initial results came back super quick in about two days. My passing attempt results came back in about 2 weeks, during which time I was dying to find out. Surprisingly I never received any feedback or emails, but I did find my certification waiting for me inside my account!! Heck yea. Side note: I do believe you're supposed to get feedback on both attempts(?) I’m not sure what happened there.

### My background

Prior to taking the exam I had completed quite a few multiple choice certifications like CompTIA's Pentest+, CASP+, and Security+. Did they help me at all for the exam? Eh it's hard to say. None of it was wasted time since all of your prior knowledge will build upon itself. It also helped that all of my previous cert's were paid for by the military so… Do you need any other certifications or education before taking CPTS? *Well… no,* **that's the best part of it**, the academy is designed to teach you things from the ground up. One caveat to this is that knowing the basics like networking, RDP, SSH, Active Directory, Linux and DNS will make the academy lessons go much smoother. The less you know the longer the academy will take you, so keep that in mind. If you're a complete newbie I'd honestly recommend starting with the [CBBH](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-bug-bounty-hunter) before attempting CPTS. It's much smaller and significantly easier! The academy path also overlaps with CPTS, meaning completing the CBBH path will complete ~50% of the CPTS path and vice versa. The overlap is convenient if you end up doing both certs.

### My thoughts

Overall, I found the exam to be accurately calibrated to my skill level which made it quite challenging! but yet realistic and attainable. Besides a few hours filled with banging my head against a wall, it was pretty fun. There were no crazy hidden secrets or 'gotcha' flags. I think HTB did a great job with both the course and the exam. It gets my full recommendation to entry level folks looking to take their first hands-on hacking certification. I really hope it becomes as popular as the OSCP, especially considering the all the quality content HTB is currently releasing. My only real complaint was that some of the academy module questions were oddly worded and it was hard to tell what exactly they were looking for. Also there is no search feature for HTB Enterprise users, so you have to manually search through modules… total pain. 

⏸️ A quick note on CPTS vs OSCP: I don't want to comment too much on this just yet, since I haven't taken the OSCP yet. I'll update this when I do but both Will and PinkDraconian do a good job of comparing the two in their videos (Check them out under [resources](https://mttgit19.github.io/unknownrider/#resources). But TL;DR the quality of CPTS materials wins hands down. If your resume isn't making it past HR, there are probably other issues to look at. Take CPTS first, then take OSCP when you're not the one paying for it.

## Who is the exam for

This is taken from Hackthebox's official website but I think it’s worth repeating...

> The mission of Academy’s Penetration Tester job-role path that leads to HTB CPTS (HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist) is to teach you, guide you and prepare you for the final exam. Any beginner can start practicing on the related modules and build their knowledge on penetration testing.

True. This is why this exam is great for entry level folks because completing the academy path first really gives you a solid set of base knowledge.

> More experienced professionals can also benefit from both the Penetration Tester job-role path and the HTB CPTS exam, as they can help them learn new tricks related to penetration testing and gain additional hands-on experience.

I think experienced folks should really give this exam a shot. I know a few senior pentesters who took the exam expecting to blow through it and they were very surprised at how challenging it was. Although one of the biggest complaints I hear from more experienced pentesters is that they wish they didn’t have to complete the entire academy path in order to sit for the exam. I'm getting off topic but I wonder if a possible solution to this would be to offer another exam purchase option for an absurd price like $1500. The typical academy to exam path would still exist for the same price, but the high price tag option would allow the buyer to bypass the academy requirement. The high price tag would likely be out of reach for most, but would still be feasible for those with an employer covering the bill. Maybe this would help bring in more notoriety and entice some senior level testers to take the exam. Who knows

> The main focus of this certification is to be realistic, so anyone can automatically apply what they learn in their field, regardless of it being penetration testing, security analysis, incident handling, or vulnerability assessment.  

There’s that word ‘realistic’ again… It’s almost like the exam isn't insanely complicated and is based on the academy modules. 😉

## On note taking

Working in a 'long term' engagement can get tricky. Chances are on day 7 you’ll forget everything you did on day 1. By the time you do your report? Forget it, your brain might just be a potato. So keep those `great notes` you've been taking, organized. Let me explain.

Example of a garbage note:

```bash
# I used a DC Sync attack to escalate from user to root:
# Then:
cat flag1.txt
HTB{FLAG1}
```

What IP and hostname is this on? Who is the user?? What tool did I use? What was the attack syntax? Oh crap my note just generated more questions than it answered!!

No, I totally did not do this *AT ALL* during the exam...
You may get distracted and fall into rabbit holes, so keep on eye on how your notes are shaping up as you progress.

Here's a few pointers for taking better notes:

- Before you figure out the correct path to the flag, you'll be throwing things at the wall to see what sticks... Do yourself a favor and separate your notes into sections, one way to do this is to have a 'scratch pad' and a 'walk through'. Your 'scratch pad' will be temporary notes to find the payloads that actually work, you'll also reference this section to make sure you're not repeating yourself.
- Your 'walk through' will be your finalized path to the flag. These notes will be the exact steps you took to get to the flag. You should be able to easily copy/paste these commands into your terminal to regain access. In general you should keep your walk through very organized and include things like:
1. IP + Hostname
2. Specific vulnerability you found
3. Exact commands to get to the flag (in the correct sequence)
4. File paths / locations of key findings.

Keep in mind you can use the above technique with your screenshots as well. Not sure if something's important? Take some screenshots and place them in a separate 'investigations' folder. Remember you do not have to include every single screenshot in your final report... In fact you shouldn't because who the heck wants to look at 300 pages of blurry screenshots. Keep it efficient. Having all these commands and screenshots ready to go for the report will make it go much quicker. 10 days seems like a lot of time but it goes quickly!

## Recommended practice
A lot of students wonder what else they can do to practice before taking the exam. Honestly there isn't a ton...  #justsendit

I've done a few pro labs including Dante and Zephyr, and I don't particularly recommend them as extra practice before the exam. You'll want to stick to the academy topics pretty closely. The only additional academy module (non-pentest path) that would be beneficial would be the Bloodhound one. Ranking up on the HTB platform or solving older boxes can be helpful to get some practice dialing-in your methodology and note taking. I'd say you should feel comfortable solving any easy level box, especially those involving Active directory or Windows/Linux privilege escalation. HTB academy actually recommends certain boxes if look inside the specific academy module. Personally I'd use these if you are looking for extra practice. You can even set a timer and see how fast you can solve them.
