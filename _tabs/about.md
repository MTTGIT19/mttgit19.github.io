> Welcome to my slice of the internet! Where I write about cybersecurity, effective learning, and tech topics I find interesting.  
{: .prompt-info }
  
I currently work as a Penetration tester but I took a *VERY* non-standard route into the Cybersecurity world. I spent a lot of time in the world of military aviation before I transitioned to civilian life, so you may notice [brevity codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiservice_tactical_brevity_code) and other military lingo. During my career I fixed (and broke) my fair share of expensive electronics. I love to learn, tinker and figure out how stuff works. 
    
While I mostly write for myself, I was inspired to open source my learning by some very well written articles on the internet about [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). Thanks for reading!
