> Welcome! This is my digital home, where I write about learning, life and interesting tech topics.

> I currently work as a Penetration tester but I took a *VERY* non-standard route into the Cybersecurity world. You may have already noticed the aviation theme. That's because I spent a large portion of my career in military aviation. Isn't the lingo awesome? Clear and concise with awesome  [brevity codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiservice_tactical_brevity_code). During my military career I fixed (and broke) my fair share of  very expensive electronics. I love to learn, tinker and figure out how stuff works.

While I mostly write for myself, I was inspired to open source my learning by some very well written articles on the internet about learning in public. I’ve always been an internet ‘lurker’… reading, watching and consuming, research papers, articles, videos, anything really. I figured it was about time to start creating.
