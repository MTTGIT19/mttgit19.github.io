> Welcome to my slice of the internet! Where I write about cybersecurity, effective learning, and tech topics I find interesting.  
{: .prompt-info }
  
I currently work as a Penetration tester but I took a *VERY* non-standard route into the Cybersecurity world. You may have already noticed the aviation theme and my abundant use of lingo. That's because I spent a large portion of my work life in military aviation. Yes, the lingo is as cool as it sounds in Top Gun. Clear and concise with cool [brevity codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiservice_tactical_brevity_code). During my military career I fixed (and broke) my fair share of very expensive electronics. I love to learn, tinker and figure out how stuff works. 
    
While I mostly write for myself, I was inspired to open source my learning by some very well written articles on the internet about [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). I’ve always been an internet ‘lurker’… reading, watching and consuming. I figured it was about time to start creating.
